## About

This repository contains a presentation `./prompt_learning_presentation.pdf` and exemplary notebooks regarding prompting methods for NLP:
 * `./prompt-learning demo`: This notebook shows how to use the [`OpenPrompt`](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenPrompt) library designed for prompting methods.
 * `./comparing-templates`: This is an example of how to use a Prompt-based Learning with a BERT model from HuggingFace to perform Zero-Shot Text Classification of news articles from the AG News dataset. The notebook illustrates the results achieved using different types of templates.
 
 We recommend to run the notebooks at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with GPU/TPU environment.

The presentation is based on an excellent survey: [link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3560815)
